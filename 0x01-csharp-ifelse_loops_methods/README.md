    <h1>Project: CSharp Conditionals</h1>
    <p><strong>In this project we'll learn about C# conditionals.</strong></p>

        <li><strong>Task 0:</strong> This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 1:</strong> This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 4:</strong> Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)</li>
        <li><strong>Task 5:</strong> Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 6:</strong> Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 7:</strong> Write a method that checks for lowercase character.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 8:</strong> Write a method that prints the last digit of a number.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 9:</strong> Write a method that adds two integers and returns the result.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 10:</strong> Write a method that draws a straight line in the terminal.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 11:</strong> Write a method that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 12:</strong> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.</li>
