<h1>Project: CSharp Inheritance</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we'll be reviewing one of the three pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Nonetheless Polymorphism will also take place in this exercises.</strong></p>
<body>
<li><strong>Task 0:</strong> Write a method that returns True if the object is an int, otherwise return False</li>
<li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Write a method that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, Array, otherwise return False</li>
<li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Write a method that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherits from the specified class, otherwise return False. The object must be a subclass; your method cannot return True if the object is an instance of the base class.</li>
<li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Write a method that prints the names of the available properties and methods of an object. See example for output format.</li>
<li><strong>Task 4:</strong> Write a empty class Dog that inherits from empty class Animal</li>
<li><strong>Task 5:</strong> Write a class Shape</li>
<li><strong>Task 6:</strong> Based on 5-shape, write a class Rectangle that inherits from Shape</li>
<li><strong>Task 7:</strong> Based on 6-shape, write a class Rectangle that inherits from Shape</li>
<li><strong>Task 8:</strong> Based on 7-shape, write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle</li>
<li><strong>Task 9:</strong> Based on 8-shape, write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle</li>
<li><strong>Task 10:</strong> Write a blog post that explains the problem with implementing a Square class as a derived class of Rectangle. It should cover:
    <ul>
<li>what Liskov’s substitution principle is</li>
<li>why Square inheriting from Rectangle is not an ideal design choice</li>
<li>ways that this class hierarchy could be improved</li>
    </ul>
</li>
