<h1>Project: CSharp Arrays, Lists and Dictionaries</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will review how generic collections work, we'll be reviewing specifically about arrays, lists and dictionaries. This will be nice to start getting along with C# basics.</strong></p>
<body>
<li><strong>Task 0:</strong> Write a method that creates and prints an array of integers of a given size.</li>
<li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Write a method that retrieves an element from an array.</li>
<li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Write a method that replaces an element of an array at a given index.</li>
<li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Write a method that prints all integers of an array, in reverse order.</li>
<li><strong>Task 4:</strong> Write a method that creates and prints a list of integers of a given size.</li>
<li><strong>Task 5:</strong> Write a method that finds the biggest integer of a list.</li>
<li><strong>Task 6:</strong> Write a method that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.</li>
<li><strong>Task 7:</strong> Write a method that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.</li>
<li><strong>Task 8:</strong> Write a method that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.</li>
<li><strong>Task 9:</strong> Write a method that adds a key and value to a dictionary.</li>
<li><strong>Task 10:</strong> Write a method that deletes a key in a dictionary</li>
<li><strong>Task 11</strong> Write a method that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.</li>
<li><strong>Task 12:</strong> Write a method that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.</li>
<li><strong>Task 13:</strong> Write a method that returns the key with the biggest integer value in a given dictionary.</li>
<li><strong>Task 14:</strong> Write a program that creates and prints a 5 by 5 two-dimensional array and initialize index [2,2] to 1 and all other indices to 0.</li>
<li><strong>Task 15:</strong> Write a method that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Task 1:</strong> Write a program that creates and prints a jagged array containing 3 arrays.</li>
